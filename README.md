# Vidyastaan - India's #1 Peer-to-Peer Learning Platform for V

> **A new possibility for every child** — Connecting underserved school students with passionate college volunteers for academic support and real-world skill development.

Vidyastaan is a comprehensive platform that bridges the education gap in India by enabling peer-to-peer mentorship between college volunteers and school students. Our mission is to ensure every child gets the personalized guidance they deserve, regardless of their socioeconomic background.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve
